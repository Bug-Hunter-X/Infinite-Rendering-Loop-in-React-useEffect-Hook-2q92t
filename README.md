This repository demonstrates a common error in React applications: an infinite rendering loop caused by the useEffect hook. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue stems from omitting the dependency array in `useEffect`, causing it to re-run on every render, triggering an infinite loop because the state variable, count, is updated during each render cycle. The solution demonstrates the correct use of the dependency array to ensure the effect only runs when the `count` variable changes.
